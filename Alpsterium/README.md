This folder contains the GERBERS files and plate files that you can use to create a Mysterium keyboard, but using Apple's AEK layout and keycaps.

No warrany is applicable or implied, this project was merely a proof of concept.

NOTE: The current Mysterium cases are not designed to accomodate the function row of the AEK keyboard, so the function keys will stand taller than the rest if the keys.
